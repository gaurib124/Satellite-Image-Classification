## üìå Introduction

Satellite image classification plays a crucial role in applications such as **land cover mapping**, **urban planning**, and **environmental monitoring**. This project leverages **deep learning (CNNs)** to classify satellite images into ten categories:
**AnnualCrop, Forest, HerbaceousVegetation, Highway, Industrial, Pasture, PermanentCrop, Residential, River, SeaLake.**

---

## üóÇ Dataset

We use the **EuroSAT dataset**, which contains **27,000 labeled images** of various land use and land cover types. Each image is **64x64 pixels** and categorized into:

* AnnualCrop
* Forest
* HerbaceousVegetation
* Highway
* Industrial
* Pasture
* PermanentCrop
* Residential
* River
* SeaLake
