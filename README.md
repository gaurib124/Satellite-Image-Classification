## 📌 Introduction

Satellite image classification plays a crucial role in applications such as **land cover mapping**, **urban planning**, and **environmental monitoring**. This project leverages **deep learning (CNNs)** to classify satellite images into ten categories:
**AnnualCrop, Forest, HerbaceousVegetation, Highway, Industrial, Pasture, PermanentCrop, Residential, River, SeaLake.**

---

## 🗂 Dataset

We use the **EuroSAT dataset**, which contains **27,000 labeled images** of various land use and land cover types. Each image is **64x64 pixels** and categorized into:

* AnnualCrop
* Forest
* HerbaceousVegetation
* Highway
* Industrial
* Pasture
* PermanentCrop
* Residential
* River
* SeaLake

## ⚙️ Methodology

### **Data Preprocessing**

✔ Normalization: Pixel values scaled to \[0, 1]
✔ Tensor conversion
✔ One-Hot encoding for labels
✔ Train-Validation-Test Split
✔ Data Augmentation: flips, brightness adjustments

### **Model Building**

A custom CNN **SpectrumNet** with multiple convolutional layers, **Batch Normalization**, and **ReLU activation**.

### **Model Training**

* Optimizer: **SGD with momentum**
* Loss: **Categorical Cross-Entropy**
* Early Stopping & Learning Rate Scheduler

### **Model Evaluation**

Evaluated on **accuracy, confusion matrix**, and tested for generalization.

### **Optimizing Performance**

Achieved **96% accuracy** on the test set.
